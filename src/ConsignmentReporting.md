## Overview
Within many excess stock agreements with distributors, there often is a clause that requires Astute to provide a monthly inventory stock report and a list of items sold within the last agreed upon period. This allows take splits to happen accordingly as well as serve as a security exercise. This guide will break down the different consignment reporting requirements between Astuteâ€™s excess programs.
