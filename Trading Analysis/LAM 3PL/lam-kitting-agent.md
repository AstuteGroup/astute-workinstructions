# LAM Kitting Email Agent Workflow

Process LAM approval emails, new award notifications, and related correspondence on the `lamkitting@orangetsunami.com` inbox.

---

## Overview

| Setting | Value |
|---------|-------|
| **Inbox** | `lamkitting@orangetsunami.com` |
| **Cron** | Every 1h (`:15` past) |
| **Master Roster** | `Trading Analysis/LAM 3PL/LAM_Master_Roster.xlsx` |
| **Flagged Review** | `Trading Analysis/LAM 3PL/data/lam-flagged-review.json` |
| **Handler** | `shared/workflow-actions/lam-kitting.js` |

---

## APPROVAL + FLAGGING PATTERN

This workflow uses a hybrid approval pattern:

1. **Explicit approvals** (price, lead time) → **APPLIED immediately**
2. **Other field discrepancies** detected in email → **FLAGGED for review**
3. **Status = "Additional Review"** set on parts with flagged items
4. **Summary email** sent: "Applied X, please review Y"
5. **Operator replies** APPROVE/SKIP for flagged items
6. **Downstream visibility** — parts with "Additional Review" status appear in reorder alerts

### Why This Pattern?

- Explicit approvals don't wait — price approved → update immediately
- Implicit/detected changes get human review — prevents cascading errors
- Nothing falls through the cracks — Status flag ensures visibility
- Other workflows see pending reviews — reorder alerts show parts needing attention

---

## CRITICAL: All Outreach is INTERNAL-ONLY

**NEVER email LAM contacts directly.** All clarification emails go to Jake (operator) only.

---

## Request Types Handled

| Type | Description | Action | Auto-Apply? |
|------|-------------|--------|-------------|
| **Price approval** | LAM approves proposed resale price | `approve_price` | Yes |
| **Lead time approval** | LAM approves contractual lead time | `approve_leadtime` | Yes |
| **Other field mentions** | MOQ, threshold, base price in email | Flagged | No — operator decides |
| **New award** | LAM adds new CPC to contract | `add_award` | Yes (after MFR validation) |
| **Rejection** | LAM rejects proposal | `reject` | N/A |
| **Flagged item reply** | Operator approves/skips flagged item | `approve_flagged` / `skip_flagged` | Per operator |

---

## Discrepancy Detection

When processing an approval email, the agent should:

### 1. Extract the Explicit Approval
- **Price approval:** CPC + approved resale price
- **Lead time approval:** CPC + new lead time

### 2. Scan for Other Field Mentions
Look for mentions of:
- **Lead Time:** "16 weeks", "8 week lead time", "stock"
- **MOQ:** "minimum order 100", "MOQ: 50"
- **Reorder Threshold:** "reorder at 25", "threshold 100"
- **Base Price:** "cost $8.50", "unit cost"

### 3. Build emailMentions Object
```json
{
  "leadTime": "16 WEEKS",
  "moq": 100,
  "reorderThreshold": 50,
  "basePrice": 8.50
}
```

### 4. Handler Compares Against Roster
The handler automatically:
- Applies the explicit approval
- Compares emailMentions to current roster values
- If different → flags as discrepancy
- Sets Status = "Additional Review"
- Sends summary email with both sections

---

## Summary Email Format

When discrepancies are detected:

```
LAM Approval Applied + Review Needed: 608-096583-504

✓ APPLIED CHANGES
| Field        | Previous | New Value |
|--------------|----------|-----------|
| Resale Price | $10.00   | $12.50    |

⚠️ FLAGGED FOR REVIEW
| Field     | Current Roster | Email Mentions |
|-----------|----------------|----------------|
| Lead Time | 8 WEEKS        | 16 WEEKS       |

Reply to lamkitting@ with:
  APPROVE LEADTIME — update to 16 WEEKS
  SKIP LEADTIME — leave as-is
  SKIP ALL — skip all flagged items

Part Status set to "Additional Review" until resolved.
```

---

## Reply Handling for Flagged Items

When operator replies with APPROVE/SKIP:

### APPROVE Commands
- `APPROVE LEADTIME` → Update Lead Time to email value
- `APPROVE MOQ` → Update MOQ to email value
- `APPROVE REORDERTHRESHOLD` → Update Reorder Threshold
- `APPROVE BASEPRICE` → Update Base Unit Price

### SKIP Commands
- `SKIP LEADTIME` → Leave Lead Time unchanged, remove flag
- `SKIP ALL` → Skip all flagged items for this CPC

### After Processing
- Remaining flagged count decremented
- When count reaches 0 → Status = "Additional Review" cleared
- Part returns to normal status in reorder workflows

---

## Downstream Workflow Visibility

### Reorder Alerts (`lam-kitting-reorder.js`)
Should check for Status = "Additional Review" and include in output:

```javascript
const { getFlaggedCPCs } = require('../shared/workflow-actions/lam-kitting');
const flaggedCPCs = getFlaggedCPCs();

// In output, add section:
// "Parts with Additional Review Pending"
// - Shows CPCs with flagged items
// - Links to flagged-review.json for details
```

### Pending Approvals Report
Parts with Status = "Additional Review" appear separately from "Pending Approval"

---
